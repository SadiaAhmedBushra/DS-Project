# Food Delivery Management System


## Project Overview

We have created a project to manage the activities of a cloud kitchen order and delivery
system.
In this project, there are two separate menus: one for the authority and another for the
customers under the main menu. Access to the authority menu is restricted by a
password. By using the correct password, the members of the authority can access the
authority menu. The authority will then be able to do the following things: add food items
to their menu, search for a food item by using either the name or code of the food,
remove any food item from the menu, update the price and code of any food item,
confirm the orders, see customerâ€™s delivery confirmation, and finally see the reviews left
by the customers.
In the customer menu, the customers can view the menu of the restaurant, sort the menu
according to their convenience, search for their desired food item, and order food.
Besides that, the customers can also check the status of their order (if the order is
confirmed from the restaurant or not), confirm the authority after receiving their food, and
also leave their own valuable thoughts about the food and service. As this is a newly
opened restaurant, the customers will get a 20% discount on their purchase if they order
food for the value of more than 500tk. The details of the menu of the restaurant,
customer order, delivery status, and reviews will be saved in separate files.
